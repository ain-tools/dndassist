On a hit, the tentacle deals {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.",
				"The Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.",
				"To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again\u2014and moving closer to each other all the time.",

Since then, other aetherborn have learned and carried out this monstrous transformation, and aetherborn with this \"gift\" have become a small minority among an already small population.",
						"A gifted aetherborn has the ability to drain the life essence of other beings. Similar to the way heat is transferred from a warm object to a cold one, a gifted aetherborn need only touch another living being with a clawed hand to draw life essence out, fueling their own continued existence while draining strength and vitality from their victim.",
						"For many aetherborn, living as they do for indulgence and instant gratification, the concepts of \"want\" and \"need\" are virtually synonymous. But Aetherborn with this gift understand what it is to truly need, for they develop a hunger for life essence that far exceeds any desires they might have felt before their transformation. A gifted aetherborn who abstains from this feeding deteriorates even more rapidly than other aetherborn, while enduring unspeakable agony caused by the deprivation of life energy.",
						"At the DM's option, an aetherborn character can research methods of achieving this dark \"gift.\" The process is similar to inventing and manufacturing a rare magic item (see \"Inventing and Manufacturing Devices\" earlier in this document). But rather than aether, the process requires a variety of rare unguents and unusual ingredients that make up the cost of researching and undergoing the transformation.",
						"An aetherborn with this gift gains the Drain Life ability: a natural attack that deals {@dice 1d6} necrotic damage and restores the same number of hit points to the aetherborn. However, if the aetherborn goes for 7 days without dealing this damage, their hit point maximum is reduced by {@dice 1d6} per week. This reduction can't be removed until the aetherborn has used their Drain Life ability and completed a long rest."

					"entries": [
						"Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, walls of ice, teleportation, and the like. Other spells, such as charm person, display no visible, audible, or otherwise perceptible sign of their effects, and could easily go unnoticed by someone unaffected by them. As noted in the Player's Handbook, you normally don't know that a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a noticeable effect.",
						"But what about the act of casting a spell? Is it possible for someone to perceive that a spell is being cast in their presence? To be perceptible, the casting of a spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or material component. The form of a material component doesn't matter for the purposes of perception, whether it's an object specified in the spell's description, a component pouch, or a spellcasting focus.",
						"If the need for a spell's components has been removed by a special ability, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the spell is imperceptible. If an imperceptible casting produces a perceptible effect, it's normally impossible to determine who cast the spell in the absence of other evidence."

				{
					"type": "entries",
					"name": "Identifying a Spell",
					"entries": [
						"Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.",
						"If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with their reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.",
						"This Intelligence (Arcana) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their spells."

But what happens if a spell targets something that isn't a valid target? For example, someone might cast charm person on a creature believed to be a humanoid, not knowing that the target is in fact a vampire. If this issue comes up, handle it using the following rule.",
						"If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by the spell, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is in fact an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target."

If an area of effect is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects that square.",
						"That rule works, but it can require a fair amount of on-the-spot adjudication. This section offers two alternatives for determining the exact location of an area: the template method and the token method. Both of these methods assume you're using a grid and miniatures of some sort.

If any part of a square is under the template, that square is included in the area of effect. If a creature's miniature is in an affected square, that creature is in the area. Being adjacent to the edge of the template isn't enough for a square to be included in the area of effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by the template.",
										"You can also use this method without a grid. If you do so, a creature is included in an area of effect if any part of the miniature's base is overlapped by the template.",
										"When you place a template, follow all the rules in the Player's Handbook for placing the associated area of effect.

The opposite side of the space determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs.",
				"On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's space and create a wedge shape expanding out from there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature are its side arcs.",
				"A square or hex might be in more than one arc, depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in the side arc."

				"Combat can feel very mechanical. {@i I move 10 feet. I make an attack roll. I use a reaction.} One way for the DM to encourage more cinematic action is to present a list of Environmental Elements. In a tavern, this list could include Chandelier, Plate Glass Window, Roaring Fireplace, Tray of Drinks, Drunk Patron. If you're fighting in an ancient tomb the list could be Pile of Gold Coins, Scattered Bones, Rotting Tapestry, Moss-Covered Statue. Each turn, a player can work one of these elements into their description of their action. The primary purpose of this is to give players ideas; interesting details to use while describing their actions. But if a player comes up with a particularly clever way to use an element, the DM could grant advantage on a check or attack roll, or some other benefit. The rogue needs to cross a room full of enemies and wants to swing on the chandelier? As the DM, I'd let them make a simple Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid opportunity attacks, essentially getting a free Disengage action.",
				"Environmental elements are always  optional and largely cosmetic. As a DM, you  don't have to grant a bonus for every use of an   element.
